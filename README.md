# All the Fishes 
## Under the deep blue sea
### ReadMe
### In this assignment I chose to keep things simple and created an aquarium that has an authentic "under the sea look" with minimal animation. This assignment was fun yet also challenging I did my best to add as much movement as I could to give the image life by adding the changing color fish as well as the fish moving across the screen. I will admit it was challenging having to edit the scale size in order to position everything where I wanted it to be but overall I did by best and I am proud.
